STAGEONE
========

Stageone is a very minimalist child theme of the new Bootstrap4 based theme_boost from MoodleHQ.

StageOne is intended as a starting point for development only and not for use as a main theme.
It contains no settings of its own and no styling other than what is inherited from Boost.

It does have one additional folder/file beyond what would be strictly necessary for a true
minimalist Boost child - style/custom.css. This does allow css to be included in the child theme,
but it should be noted that css cam already be added to the raw SCSS settings in the Boost
theme, so this would only be necessary for someone who needs to easily port that css between
Moodle instances using their child theme.
